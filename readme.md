## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/infoshareacademy/jpydzr1-dkmap-django.git
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ python3 -m venv <venv-name>
$ source <venv-name>/bin/activate
```

Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(<venv-name>)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(venv-name)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `venv`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(<venv-name>)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
